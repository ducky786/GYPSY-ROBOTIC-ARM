# GYPSY-ROBOTIC-ARM
Gypsy is a 5 axis robotic arm powered by a Raspberry Pi4 small enough, to play around with on your desk.

### Research
This is my biggest project yet! I have wanted to build a robotic arm for a long time now and seeing I have gained a lot of experience from my previous projects; I am much more confident in starting this big one! I feel that I would end up learning a ton on CAD and Coding. This is my passion project! 

For this project I want to make sure It stays cheap as possible! Robotic arms are kind of expensive, and they are a great way of learning key robotics concepts like inverse kinematics (which I hope to learn). So I hope to keep this project cheap as possible for anyone who might wanna try building this!

At the start of the project, I originally wanted to create 6 axis robotic arm all powered with Nema Stepper motors! But... seeing all the other robotic arm projects, I felt it would end up becoming really expensive and too complicated for my beginner level brain. So, I dumbed it down a little and settled on a 5 axis Robotic arm with servo motors. 

These axis include:
- The base Rotation
- The shoulder Rotation
- The Forearm Rotation
- The wrist Rotation
- The End effector 

For a robotic arm to work you need to know how to move the end effector to the desired point. To be able to do this you need to know Inverse Kinematics. This is essentially a way of mathematically solving the joint variables to get the perfect end effector position. In my research on this topic, I came across this lesson from Clemson University which does a great job on teaching this stuff. Math is not my strongest suit so I will be spending a lot of time learning this stuff.

### CAD

I started a bit Of the CAD too! This is only my third time CADing so am still learning some stuff. Today I worked on the base of GYPSY and finished a bit of the first axis. I had to think a lot on how I might want to approach this part of the axis. I Definity did NOT want to use Barings for this project as for one it would drastically increase the price of the arm due to such large Barings and also because of the past troubles I've had with them. In my last project when I used Barings, I had unfortunate results with them because of the tolerances. I never seemed to get the fit right. So, I ditched the idea of the Barings and settled on simply having two pieces loosely fit around a notch so it could spin. Sure, it might not be the smoothest, but it will spin pretty good, hopefully.
